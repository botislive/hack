# 🔗 Python Network Programming - Socket Project

This is a basic Python network programming project that demonstrates the use of **sockets** to build a simple **client-server architecture**.  
It includes:

- 🖥️ `server.py` – Listens for client connections and handles requests.  
- 💻 `client.py` – Connects to the server and sends/receives data.  
- 📦 `client.exe` – Precompiled executable of the client for quick testing (Windows only).
